# Store a variable "movie"
movie <- c("12 Angery men")

# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
  
  # Replace all of the spaces in your movie title with plus signs (+)
  movie <- gsub("\\s", "+", movie, fixed = FALSE)
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  base.url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?"

  query <- paste0("&query=", movie)
  search.url <- paste0(base.url, api.key, query)
  
  # Request data using your search query
  movie.data <- fromJSON(search.url)
  
  # Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  movie.data <- flatten(movie.data$results)
  
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables
  headline <- movie.data$headline
  summary <- movie.data$summary_short
  link <- movie.data$link.url
  
  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
  result <- list("headline" = headline, "summary" = summary, "link" = link)
  return(result)
}

# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview(movie)

```

# `r movie.info$headline`
